#### This project ia about building an application that will help us know whether a triangle is isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NOT a triangle at all.         Friday,14th december 2018
#### By **Dusabeyezu Florentine**
## Description
Based on the functionality of the application,the key points are:
* For the equilateral triangle, all the side must be equal.
* For the isoscele,two sides are exactly equal.
* For the scalene,none of the sides is equal.However the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.
* Most importantly,if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side,then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
Install triangle-tracker-js by cloning this repository:
https://github.com/tytyne/triangle

## BDD
* If all the sides are equal is an equilateral triangle
* If two of the sides are equal,is an isiscele triangle
* If all the side are not equal and the sum of any two side of the triangle is greater than the third side,is a scalene triangle
* Else if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal or less than the third remaining side,then it is not a triangle
